# INRI
Supybot/Limnoria Bible plugin.

two main issues right now are not matching at beginning of the line, and not changing translation when using Jn3:16(akjv) type stuff, works when you change the registry variable. 

It also needs to have more settings, commands to lookup languages, translations, etc., and settings to control format and output to limit lines and stuff like that.. but the framework is there and while its not very pretty in its current form, its not that complex either and is fairly well commented.
